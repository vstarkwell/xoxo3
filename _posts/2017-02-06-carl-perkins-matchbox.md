“I’m sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes. / I ain’t got no matches, but I got a long way to go. / I’m an ol’ poor boy and a long way from home. / Guess I’ll never be happy, everything I do is wrong. / Let me be your little dog, ’till your big dog comes. / When the big dog gets here, tell him what this little puppy done.”
