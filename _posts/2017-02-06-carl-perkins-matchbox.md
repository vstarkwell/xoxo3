“I’m sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes / I ain’t got no matches, but I got a long way to go / I’m an ol’ poor boy and a long way from home / Guess I’ll never be happy, everything I do is wrong / Let me be your little dog, ’till your big dog comes / When the big dog gets here, tell him what this little puppy done”
