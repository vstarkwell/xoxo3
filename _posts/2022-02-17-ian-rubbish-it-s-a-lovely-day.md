When they smash your things and throw them in the bin, you’ve got to say it’s a lovely day. / When your cup of tea is filled with a sour milk sea, you’ve got to say it’s a lovely day. / Sometimes it seems like things are falling apart. Just remember it’s all lovely. / If your bike collides with where the wasps reside you’ve got to say it’s a lovely day. / If life is changing fast the future’s just the past, you’ve got to say it’s a lovely day. / If your mates are not around and you need them when you’re down, you’ve got to hang on it’s still a lovely day / It’s been alright. I’ve had a lovely night with you.
