When they smash your things  / And throw them in the bin / You've got to say / It's a lovely day. / When your cup of tea / Is filled with a sour milk sea / You've got to say / It's a lovely day. / Sometimes it seems / Like things are falling apart / Just remember / It's all lovely. / If your bike collides / With where the wasps reside / You've got to say / It's a lovely day. / If life is changing fast / The future's just the past / You've got to say / It's a lovely day. / If your mates are not around / And you need them when you're down / You've got to hang on / It's still a lovely day / It's been alright / I've had a lovely night with you.
