I live alone with someone / We share a one bed room / His shoes are in the corner / Where they were this afternoon / Empty dishes in the cupboard / at least they can feel use / But I live alone with someone / ‘Cause together’s just a ruse / I live alone with someone / ‘Cause together is just a ruse

Now you don’t need me at all / But I’d sure love to need you / You’ve got your own shiny horn / and you don’t even have to toot / You’re just as fine dressed in rags / As you are in a three piece suit / No, you don’t need me at all / But I’d sure love to need you / You don’t need me at all / But I’d sure love to need you
